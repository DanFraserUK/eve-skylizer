# skŸlizer - The Eve-Online scan analyzer

skŸlizer is a tool for Eve Online to handle any kind of scans. At the moment only survey scans of moon are supported which has been introduced with the Liveblood expansion 25'th of October 2017.

## Features

* [for the impatient - a screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrRtg/eve-skylizer/master/public/img/skylizer_screenshot_1.jpg)
* read Moon scan data from Eve Online. Press below the scan results "copy to clipboard", then navigate to skŸlizer and paste the scan to the area to the right and then the button "submit your scan" below the area.
* search by Systemname or Constellation with autosuggest, just start typing
* easily navigate to neighbor systems, constellation or show all scanned moons in the current constellation
* show the composition, amount and value of the goo for each moon
* show the composition, amount and value of the refined minerals ("Ore") for each moon
* filter by goo or refined minerals
* order by value (which moon is the R64 equivalent)
* polls current prices from Eve via ESI call
* Help Function
* for Moon-Managers (specific right in the tool) create CSV exports
* and much more to be come...

In the future skŸlizer will become a tool to share moon, scan and dscan results and to combine the scan results. It will e.g. show after a scan which kind of structure has been anchored on a moon or somewhere else.

## Installation

To download skŸlizer as a ZIP archive, click the Clone or Download button. When download is complete, unpack the archive to some directory.
It can be your home dir or `/var/www/html`).

Then run Composer as follows:

```
php composer.phar install
```

The command above will install the dependencies, in particular Zend Framework 3 and Doctrine 2.


Add some directories manually:

```
mkdir ./data/cache
mkdir ./data/log
```

If required adjust permissions for all files and directories:

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data data
sudo find ./ -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
sudo find ./ -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
```

## Update the application

You may update using git or by updating the files manually e.g. by unzipping the distribution. 

But anyhow, after any update please mind to clear the caches with ```rm ./data/cache/*.php```.

## Update Prices

Updating the prices, fetching them from Eve Database (ESI) is only possible by using your browser or from the shell.

In order to update prices online login to skŸlizer as an admin. Then point your browser to http://your-domain/vposmoon/priceUpdate

To update prices from the shell or using a cron-tab use the command ``` /usr/bin/php -f ./bin/skylizer_cli.php price```.


## Database

Login to MySQL client:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

Create database:

```
CREATE DATABASE skylizer;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON skylizer.* TO skylizer@localhost identified by '<your_password>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit
```

Import database from your skŸlizer respository:

```
bunzip2 *.bz2
mysql -u root -p skylizer <./ressource/db_import/sl_full_dump_*.sql
```

## Apache virtual host

Then create an Apache virtual host. It should look like below:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName <your web server name, e.g. skylizer.your.domain.com>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/skylizer/public
    
    <Directory /path/to/skylizer/public/>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
```

## Application Configuration

Create `config/autoload/local.php` config file by copying its distrib version:

```
cp config/autoload/local.php.dist config/autoload/local.php
```

Edit **`config/autoload/local.php`** and set various parameters. Hint: you may look out for '// @' inside the file in order to identify where settings have to made.

> **Please mind:** below you'll find some configuration examples. Text in **arrow brackets** ('<' and '>') has to be replaced by your input. The arrow brackets have to be **removed** too.

#### EVE Online SSO access

First go to [EVE Online developers portal](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) to obtain some credentials. 
What you need to have available is:
> your webserver URL. Please add `/auth/index` to your URl in order to generate the *redirect URL*
> as scope please add `publicData` and `esi-location.read_location.v1`

```php
'eve_sso' => array (
	// @ generate a new EVE application at https://developers.eveonline.com/applications
	'clientId'          => '<generate it at https://developers.eveonline.com/applications>',
	'clientSecret'      => '<generate it at https://developers.eveonline.com/applications>',
	'redirectUri'       => '<your application base URL>**/auth/index',
	'scope' => [
		// @ while generating your EVE application take care to add these scopes
		'publicData', 
		'esi-location.read_location.v1'
	],
```

#### User & Corporation access

Please add at least your EVE Online player name right to ´admin´ to enable access to yourself. 
Then you may add some friends into ´user_allow´ or add your corporation (full name, not ticker!) into ´corp_allow´.
If you would like to allow anybody to access your application and to override any setting made in ´user_allow´ and ´corp_allow´ you may set ´allow_all´ to ´YeS´. Then please mind the upper and lower case!

```php
'auth' => [
	// @ Change to reflect your needs
	'allow_all' => 'no', // set to 'YeS' (mind the upper and lower case!) **to allow to any Eve-User to get access as a regular user**
	'admin' => ["<your player name>"],
	'corp_allow' => ["<your corporation>", "<another corporation>"],
	'user_allow' => ["<some player not in the corportions above", "<another player name>"],
	'user_deny' => ["<some spy in your corporation", "<another spy in your corporation>", "<your CEO's name (joke...)>"],
],
```

#### Database 

Please enter your database connection details and credentials.

```php
'doctrine' => [
	'connection' => [
		'orm_default' => [
			'driverClass' => PDOMySqlDriver::class,
			'params' => [
			// @ Change database connection to your needs
				'host'     => '<127.0.0.1>',
				'user'     => '<skylizer>',
				'password' => '<db-password>',
				'dbname'   => '<skylizer>',
			]
		],
	], 
],
```

#### Logging

You may change the logging level. By default only errors or critical errors are logged.
In case you wan to get more or less information the supported logging levels are: EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARN, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG. 
To change the log level set ´priority´ from ´Logger::ERR´ e.g. to ´Logger::DEBUG´ to switch to a log level of DEBUG - which is very noisy.
Logfiles are beeing stored in ´./data/log/´, one file each day. Please log-rotate them to avoid exceeding your hard drive capacity.

```php
	'log' => [
        'MyLogger' => [
            'writers' => [
                [
                    'name' => 'stream',
					// @ Change loglevel to your needs, recommended Logger::ERR
					// supported levels: EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARN, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG
                    'priority' => Logger::ERR,
                    'options' => [
                        'stream' => './data/log/atlog_'.date('ymd').'.log',
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
	],
```
